After you have downloaded the folder, first open "Character_Deaths_A_Song_Ice_Fire.rmd" and hit run. The source file "Character_Deaths_Source.R" and "DBDA2E-utilities.R" are linked in the rmd file. 
The dataset character-predictions.csv will be automatically loaded. 
The folders are saved pdf plots generated by JAGS.
The model outputs are captured by "TEMPmodel_VarSelect.txt" and "TEMPmodel.txt".
Please refer to "Character_Deathes_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire.html" for the final report. 
Since I have not included the PNG files for display within R-markdown file, so you will not see them inline, but you can look at the knitted html file.
